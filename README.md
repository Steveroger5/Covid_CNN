<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The traditional Methods of detecting covid 19 are slow and tedious and as have been seen in the case of this deadly virus the more dealay in detecting it the more patients become victim of the virus hence we need some fast procedures that could detect corona as fast as possible hence i worked on the machine learning model that could extract features from the X-ray of the lungs of patients and with accuracy of 73% can tell whether the patient is infected or not.
